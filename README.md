# Netflix-Dataset
The Netflix dataset lists movies and TV shows with details like title, genre, country, and release year. Analyzing in Excel, I removed duplicate and null values, ensuring cleaner, more accurate data. This improved data quality supported reliable insights into Netflix’s content library.
The Netflix dataset is a valuable resource that catalogs a wide array of movies and TV shows available on the Netflix platform, featuring details like title, director, cast, country, release year, rating, duration, genre, and description. To derive actionable insights from this dataset, a detailed data analysis was conducted using Microsoft Excel with a focus on data cleaning, specifically the removal of duplicate and null (missing) values.

The preliminary step involved importing the dataset into Excel and reviewing its structure to ensure all attributes were properly organized. Data cleaning commenced with the identification and removal of duplicate entries, which can occur due to repeated content listings or data import errors. Excel’s “Remove Duplicates” tool was employed to scan for and delete identical rows based on key fields such as title, release year, and type, thereby ensuring each piece of content was uniquely represented in the dataset. This not only improved the accuracy in further analyses—such as content counts and diversity studies—but also prevented skewed results caused by overcounting.

Addressing null values was the next critical step. Missing data within important fields like title, type, or country can hinder the reliability of analysis and visualization. Using filters and the "Go To Special – Blanks" feature, rows with essential missing information were highlighted. Wherever possible, missing values were supplemented using publicly available information or by cross-referencing similar entries; otherwise, those rows were excluded to preserve the quality of the analysis.

Following these data cleaning steps, the refined dataset was ready for further exploration. Exploratory analysis included creating pivot tables to compare counts of movies and TV shows, identifying dominant genres, and tracking release trends across years and countries. Visualizations like charts and graphs were constructed to effectively communicate these trends and findings.

In summary, the systematic removal of duplicate and null entries in the Netflix dataset using Excel greatly enhanced the data’s reliability and integrity. This cleaned dataset laid the foundation for accurate, insightful analysis, enabling a deeper understanding of the breadth and evolution of Netflix’s streaming catalog.
